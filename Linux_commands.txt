Q1. How do you check the running processes and system load?
A: Use top or htop for real-time, dynamic monitoring of CPU, memory, and running processes. Use ps aux to view a static snapshot of all processes.

Q2. How do you check if a service is running and restart it?
A: Use systemctl status <service_name> to check the status. Use systemctl restart <service_name> to restart it. (Also acceptable: older service <service_name> status/restart).

Q3. How do you monitor logs in real-time?
A: Use the command tail -f /var/log/application.log (or relevant path). The -f flag stands for "follow," which streams the newest lines written to the file as they occur.

Q4. What is the difference between df and du?
A: df -h (disk filesystem) shows the disk usage of the mounted filesystems (partitions). du -sh /path/ (disk usage) shows the disk usage of a specific directory or file. -h makes the output human-readable.

Q5. Explain the importance of file permissions (CHMOD).
A: File permissions (read r=4, write w=2, execute x=1) control which User, Group, and Others can interact with a file. Permissions like 755 mean User has all access (4+2+1=7), and Group/Others have read/execute (4+1=5).

Q6. How do you find which process is listening on a specific port?
A: Use the command sudo lsof -i :<port_number> or sudo netstat -tulnp | grep :<port_number>. This is essential for troubleshooting "address already in use" errors.

Q7. What is an INODE?
A: An INODE (Index Node) is a data structure on a Linux filesystem that stores metadata about a file or directory (owner, permissions, size, creation time, disk block locations). When you run out of inodes, you cannot create new files, even if disk space is available.

Q8. What is a "soft link" (symlink)?
A: A soft link (created with ln -s) is an alias or shortcut to a file or directory. It points to the original file's pathname. If the original file is deleted, the soft link breaks and points to nothing.

Q9. How do you find a specific file or command on the system?
A: Use find /path -name 'filename.txt' to search for files. Use which <command_name> (e.g., which java or which docker) to find the full executable path of a command.

Q10. What is the difference between apt and yum / dnf?
A: They are both package managers. apt is used by Debian-based distributions (Ubuntu). yum or the newer dnf is used by RedHat-based distributions (CentOS/RHEL). They handle installing, upgrading, and removing software packages.
